So inorder to find out the diameter wise concentricity we can simply multiply the calling function at file helpermath.cs on line number 2840 which is Cdim class value obtained by
calling the function MeasureDistance. Since the reference is fixed with any one circle we can simply return the (calculated value by function) * 2.



Version 3.76
{

			case RapidEnums::MEASUREMENTTYPE::DIM_CONCENTRICITY:
			case RapidEnums::MEASUREMENTTYPE::DIM_CONCENTRICITY_D:
				Cdim = new DimConcentricity(_T("Concen"));
				Cdim->MeasurementType = CurrentMtype;
				((DimConcentricity*)Cdim)->CalculateMeasurement(s1, s2);
				break;	


}

New Version would contain something like
{
  case RapidEnums::MEASUREMENTTYPE::DIM_CONCENTRICITY:
			case RapidEnums::MEASUREMENTTYPE::DIM_CONCENTRICITY_D:
				Cdim = new DimConcentricity(_T("Concen"));
				Cdim->MeasurementType = CurrentMtype;
				((DimConcentricity*)Cdim)->2 * CalculateMeasurement(s1, s2);
				break;	


}


This is the only thing I suggest because currently my machine is not working.
So I can't test it.

Next day(Monday) when officials will come then I'll test the code and increase the version control.

The Documentation of this module is going to be like the same because it was the bug reported.

The helper file is in CPP which supports the opengl to draw the mathematical object(circle)
Thus I will look for this, is there anything we need to solve the problem of Concentrictiy.

Machine is not There so I can't do that today but I'll fix that other day.
